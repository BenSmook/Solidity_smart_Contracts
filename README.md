# Project Description: Joint Savings Smart Contract

## Overview

This project is a demonstration of a Solidity smart contract that enables two users to control a joint savings account on an Ethereum-compatible blockchain. The smart contract allows users to deposit and withdraw funds from the account, and it enforces withdrawal limits and minimum balances set by the financial institution. This project is part of a fintech startup's efforts to automate financial processes and features in the finance industry, such as hosting joint savings accounts.

## Project Files

The project files include:
- `JointSavings.sol`: The Solidity smart contract code for the Joint Savings Account.
- `test/JointSavings.test.js`: The JavaScript code for testing the Joint Savings Account functionality in the JavaScript VM.

## Instructions

The steps for this project are divided into the following sections:

1. Create a Joint Savings Account Contract in Solidity: Write the Solidity code for the Joint Savings Account smart contract, which should include functions for depositing and withdrawing funds, enforcing withdrawal limits, and setting minimum balances.
2. Compile and Deploy Your Contract in the JavaScript VM: Use the Remix IDE to compile and deploy your smart contract to the JavaScript VM.
3. Interact with Your Deployed Smart Contract: Use the Remix IDE to test your smart contract by depositing and withdrawing funds, and verifying that the withdrawal limits and minimum balances are enforced.

This project is intended for educational purposes only and should not be used in a production environment without further review and testing.
